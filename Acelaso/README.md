This application is a dependent mobile application designed for Android Platform and has been created by me for the Drug 
Monitoring Device created during the course work of ECE 522(Medical Instrumentation). This application has the potential to 
become a commercial product with the drug monitoring smart watch device. This device has been created using the 
ANDROID STUDIO IDE. It's minimum API  dependency is Android API 18, because this project supports BLE and BLE_GATT.
It also has a database to store data, and can be paired with the drug monitoring watch to receive data from the user. 

This potential software is personalised and named by me after the Greek Gods=> Aceso (the goddess of the healing process) and 
Iaso (the goddess of recuperation from illness) to be Acelaso (pronounced akilaso). This project looks forward to several 
development and upgradation and integration if introduced as commercial product. 

Application created and developed by Arunava Nag. Created as per need for the IEEE publication.
